### Introduce

**Python-Snake-Game** is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions for many platforms.[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
